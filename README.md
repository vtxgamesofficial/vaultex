# Vaultex

**Vaultex is a digital content brand creating short-form videos across gaming, lifestyle, and landscape — published on TikTok.**

We run three channels, each with its own focus and audience. All content is free to watch, updated regularly, and built around one goal: making you stop scrolling.

## Our Channels

### 🎮 Vaultex Gaming
**[Follow on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@vaultex.gaming) · [Visit Website](https://gaming.vtxgames.co.uk)**

Gameplay tips, strategy guides, and in-game photography. We help you play smarter and see games differently — from hidden mechanics and optimal builds to cinematic photo mode edits that turn gameplay into art.

### 😂 Vaultex Relatable
**[Follow on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@vaultex.co) · [Visit Website](https://relatable.vtxgames.co.uk)**

The moments everyone knows but nobody talks about. School, work, social awkwardness, everyday life — if you've lived it, it's probably already on the page. Built entirely around content that makes you say *"that's literally me."*

### 🌄 Vaultex Horizons
**[Follow on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@vaultex.horizons) · [Visit Website](https://horizons.vtxgames.co.uk)**

Cinematic landscape and travel content. Mountain peaks, city skylines, coastal views, and the quiet moments in between — all scouted, timed, and composed with intention. Built to make you pause.
